STORY

The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt is a story-driven, next-generation open world role-playing game, set in a visually stunning fantasy universe, full of meaningful choices and impactful consequences. You play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter tasked with finding a child from an ancient prophecy.

Geralt of Rivia, is a witcher, or monster hunter for hire, a white-haired and cat-eyed legend in his own time. Trained from early childhood and mutated to gain superhuman skills, strength and reflexes, witchers like Geralt are a natural consequence of and counterbalance to the monster-infested world in which they live. As Geralt, you’ll embark on an epic journey in a war-ravaged world that will inevitably lead you to confront a foe darker than anything humanity has faced so far—the Wild Hunt.
FEATURES
A GIGANTIC AND LIMITLESS OPEN WORLD TO EXPLORE

    Sail through open seas, dive in search of long lost artifacts or gallop your mount into combat—the world of the Witcher beckons to be explored. Visit the luxurious and corrupt city of Novigrad, face the frigid cold of the wind-swept Skellige islands, and challenge the dark forces roaming the forlorn, war-ravaged No Man’s Land. While on the road, use your special witcher senses to hunt down ferocious monsters and earn gold. Do anything you want, anytime you want!


UNPARRALLED NOVEL-LIKE STORY, SPANNING OVER 100 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY

    With over 100 hours of core and side-quest gameplay, The Witcher combines the intense, plot-driven pull of traditional RPGs with the freedom of choice only open world games can offer. Develop Geralt’s skills to create your unique gameplay experience, make choices and face their consequences that will stay with you throughout the entire game.


TACTICAL, RESPONSIVE, MULTI-LAYERED COMBAT SYSTEM

    Brutal, tactical and highly responsive, the combat system of The Witcher elevates skirmish mechanics to an entirely different level. Fight foes intimately, one on one, or seamlessly switch from one enemy to another as you devise your own strategies to beat the countless opponents in the game. Use the crossbow to bring down monsters just out of reach, and employ real world physics as your weapon—smash foes into walls and use the environment to your advantage.
